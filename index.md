            <p>Came from a person who don't like writing diary, and actually don't like reading at all.
            At some point, I found my initial motivation of writing is to share what I know, and I value for, as the giveback to what I learned from others.
            Every post makes me feel rewarding, and I think it's a long term win to keep my life enthusiastic.
            My interest sometimes shifts around, currently I'm interested in code :computer:, design :art:, music :headphones:, and mobile photography :camera:.</p>
