        <p>Bob’s Rehabilitation Centre aims to give rehab therapy from traditional Chinese techniques and medicine, based in Ottawa region.</p>
        <p>By talking through the specialties of their services, Bob mentioned that moxibustion is quite unique offered from him, which he thinks it’s very helpful as heat therapy.</p>
        <p>I got contacted for this website project which show cases of their clinic and services, and client just said original website doesn't look appealing and they want to change it.</p>
        <p>Considering it’s a website that is mostly for patient, and possibly elders who may suffer more from accessibility concern, I have chosen green for peaceful :leaves:, and violet for warm :relieved:. The design is clear without much decoration. The services have lots of content which I want to put focus on content and have minimal distraction from the rest. The violet color is applied on all clickable items.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I didn’t get enough resources for stock photos where the website doesn’t show retina versions for them :pensive:. It’s the first time I tried out <a href="https://glidejs.com" target="_blank">Glide.js</a>, and the result is great for these carousels, I’ll probably keep using them for my future projects, haha :smile:.</p>
        <p>The website includes both English and Chinese version which are powered by <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank">VueJS</a> i18n module, and the project is built upon a <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank">VueJS</a> framework, <a href="https://nuxtjs.org" target="_blank">NuxtJS</a>. I come from the background of strong HTML/CSS, which I love declarative more. VueJS is pretty friendly to me, and easy to pick up as of its ease learning curve.</p>
        <p>By the way, Bob’s Rehabilitation Centre just opened their second location in Kanata, which the original location is in Nepean. I do recommend visiting for massage service if you’d like to experience a more traditional Chinese style with Bob’s over 20 years experience.</p>
