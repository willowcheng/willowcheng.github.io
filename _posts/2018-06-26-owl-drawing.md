Drawing is a mistery field to me. To many people, it can be super familiar to us when we were at young age.
I started to draw when I was a kid, but gradually lost my interest as I entered primary school.

This is the first time I started to drawing again, nearly without skill practice.
After taken [Introduction to Imagemaking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/image-making) (3<sup>rd</sup> course in Graphic Design Specialization).
By drawing weekly for owls, here are what I got:

## Week 1

Started off by using Paper app, I was trying to imitate a chocolate piece of owl.

        <div class="6u 12u$(small)"><span class="image fit"><img src="/assets/img/owl-journey-start.jpg" alt="Chocolate owl" /></span></div>
        <div class="6u$ 12u$(small)"><span class="image fit"><img src="/assets/img/owl-chocolate.jpg" alt="Chocolate owl reference" /></span></div>
    </div>
</div>


## Week 2

I was interested in the brush tools in Paper, and found a great photo as reference.
Actually I was amazed what the result looks like, by combing outline and water brush,
it seems to be close to Chinese traditional ink style :thinking: .

    <div class="row uniform">
        <div class="6u 12u$(small)"><span class="image fit"><img src="/assets/img/owl-ink-style.jpg" alt="Ink style owl" /></span></div>
        <div class="6u$ 12u$(small)"><span class="image fit"><img src="/assets/img/owl-ink-reference.jpg" alt="Ink style owl reference" /></span></div>
    </div>
</div>

## Week 3

I want to try negative space that I’ve learned before,
and there is a close up shot to the owl when he's ready for hunting.
In this artwork, I doodled the black space first which looks like scratching from a paper,
then use white brush to draw outline of the owl, pencil to draw texture of woods.

<div class="box alt">
    <div class="row uniform">
        <div class="6u 12u$(small)"><span class="image fit"><img src="/assets/img/owl-negative-space.jpg" alt="Owl is hunting" /></span></div>
        <div class="6u$ 12u$(small)"><span class="image fit"><img src="/assets/img/owl-hunting-reference.jpg" alt="Reference for hunter owl" /></span></div>
    </div>
</div>

## Week 4

Love abstraction so much, I still remember the first computer game I’ve played in a pixelated resolution.
I was using Sketch to try different techniques of same shape, including ASCII art, vector with bitmap, black white.

## Week 5

This is the first time I was drawing over a photo. By leveraging the fill function in purple color,
it creates a dramatic star sky looking style, which I was inspired by drawing by gel pen tool and some creation of Chinese characters :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: .

<div class="box alt">
    <div class="row uniform">
        <div class="6u 12u$(small)"><span class="image fit"><img src="/assets/img/owl-line-drawing.jpg" alt="Owl under star sky" /></span></div>
        <div class="6u$ 12u$(small)"><span class="image fit"><img src="/assets/img/owl-star-sky-reference.jpg" alt="Owl on a tree branch reference" /></span></div>
    </div>
</div>

## Week 6

Inspired by reviewing artwork of a person who submitted his/her assignment which leverages drawing using real photos.
I collected what I have for my recent shoots after settling in Toronto, and fit them into a vector owl shape.

Can you believe I used these photos to compose the picture? :smiley:
